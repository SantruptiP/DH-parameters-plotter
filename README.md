Denavit–Hartenberg parameters

In mechanical engineering, the Denavit–Hartenberg parameters (also called DH parameters) are the four parameters associated with a particular convention for attaching reference frames to the links of a spatial kinematic chain, or robot manipulator.

Jacques Denavit and Richard Hartenberg introduced this convention in 1955 in order to standardize the coordinate frames for spatial linkages.

Richard Paul demonstrated its value for the kinematic analysis of robotic systems in 1981.While many conventions for attaching reference frames have been developed, the Denavit–Hartenberg convention remains a popular approach.
